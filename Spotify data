# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#  I then performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#I then inserted the data into the table
#I was able to use what I have learned to write questions for the data and answer those questions using SQLlite
using the following SQL

#I determined what data was in the Spotify data so as to see what data we can question
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#I determined what the artist popularity rates were
SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity BETWEEN 60 AND 80

#Then I determined the avg  danceability,energy,loudness and song mode
by artist and track

SELECT id, artist_name,avg(danceability),avg(energy),loudness,song_mode
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group By artist_name, track_name

#I then organised the tempos by Desc
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo DESC;
